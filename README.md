## Magizbox Build: Build games with pygame

Sometimes, as a technical leader in my team, I must training our new freshers about basic programming like object oriented programming. I would love to express those concepts of oop in some games and I find some concepts like inheritance and encapsulation will fit perfectly with some object in games.

So I decide to take challenge to build some games in the first Magizbox Build Series.

I built two classical games: Slither and Tank. I was super fun for building these games. Enjoy for yourself.
